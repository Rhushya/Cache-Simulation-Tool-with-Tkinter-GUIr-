# Cache Simulation Tool with Tkinter GUI

This repository contains a Python implementation of a cache simulation tool with a graphical user interface (GUI) built using Tkinter. The tool allows users to simulate different cache mapping techniques, including direct, set associative, and associative mapping. Users can input parameters such as main memory capacity, cache memory capacity, block size, and a memory trace, and view the cache simulation results in real-time.

## Features

- **Cache Simulation:** Simulate cache mapping techniques including direct, set associative, and associative mapping.
- **GUI Interface:** Interactive graphical user interface built with Tkinter for easy parameter input and result visualization.
- **Real-time Results:** View cache simulation results including cache hits, misses, and evictions in real-time.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed.
3. Install the required dependencies: `pip install tk`.
4. Run the `cache_simulation_gui.py` file.
5. Input the main memory capacity, cache memory capacity, block size, mapping technique, and memory trace.
6. Click the "Simulate" button to run the cache simulation.
7. View the cache simulation results in the output text area.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter
